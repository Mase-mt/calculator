# calculator
This JavaScript code creates a simple calculator with an additional tip calculator feature. The HTML provides the structure, including an input for displaying results, calculator buttons, and tip calculator inputs. The CSS styles the elements, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. The JavaScript functions manage the calculator's operations: `clearDisplay` clears the input, `appendToDisplay` adds values to the display, and `calculate` evaluates the expression. The `calculateTip` function computes the tip based on the bill amount and tip percentage, displaying the tip and total amount. This enhances the calculator with practical functionality for everyday use.
